calculate_coverage_over_features.py is the main script
    it needs output of the following command:
        bedtools intersect -wao intervals.bed coverage.bedgraph > bedtools_output
    usage:
    ./calculate_coverage_over_features.py bedtools_output output [coordinates/ids] [sum]
    result:
    'output' file with mean / cummulative coverage over intervals
    option 'coordinates': assume intervals.bed has three columns, outputs coordinates
    option ids: assume intervals.bed has six columns, outputs ID/name (the fourth column)
    by default mean coverage is calculated, if you add option 'sum': cummulative
    dla opcji sum liczy sumę, domyślnie średnią

calculate_coverages.sh
    that's a wrapper for the script above
    using bedtools it creates (and then removes) input needed for calculate_coverage_over_features.py
    then it runs the script
    it assumes the naming convention used in the Symfonia grant,
        i.e. coverage file is assumed to be called [experiment]_[patient]_[whatever_you_like].bedgraph
    example usage:
    ./calculate_coverages.sh features.bed H3K27me3_GB01_ignored_part.bedgraph output_suffix coordinates [sum]
    result will be called:
    H3K27me3_GB01_coverage_output_suffix.tsv

merge_results*.sh
    some helping scripts I used to merge results for several patients
    they have names and paths hard-coded, so they may need some modifications
    use "*_coords.sh" for results obtained with "coordinates" option, "*_id.sh" with "ids" option
