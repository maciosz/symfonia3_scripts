Set of scripts used to analyse data in Symfonia grant
 "An atlas of brain regulatory regions and regulatory networks -
 a novel systems biology approach to pathogenesis of selected neurological disorders".

`calculate_coverage_over_intervals` contains scripts
 to calculate cumulative or mean coverage of reads
 from NGS-based experiment
 over given set of intervals,
 e.g. cumulative signal from ATAC-seq experiment over promoters.
 Some scripts are designed to work specifically with our data,
 i.e. they assume the naming convention of samples that we used in our grant.
 Still they can be used on the same data to reproduce results.
